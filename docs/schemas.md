[source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/Root/02r30000009t000000/)  
* **getPortal**: The Portal Self resource is used to return the view of the portal as seen by the current user, anonymous or logged in. It includes information such as the name, logo, featured items, and supported protocols (HTTP vs. HTTPS) for this portal. If the user is not logged in, this call will return the default view of the portal. If the user is logged in, the view of the returned portal will be specific to the organization to which the user belongs. The default view of the portal is dependent on the culture of the user, which is obtained from the user's profile. A parameter to pass in the locale/culture is available for anonymous users.

* **getRegisteredAppInfo**: An app registered with the portal. An app item can be registered by invoking the register app operation. Every registered app gets an App ID and App Secret which in OAuth speak are known as client_id and client_secret respectively. The app owner has access to the registered app resource. This would include the organization administrator as well. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/Registered_App/02r30000026v000000/)

* **getServers**: This resource lists the ArcGIS Server sites that have been federated with the portal. This resource is not applicable to ArcGIS Online; it is only applicable to Portal for ArcGIS. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Servers/02r300000218000000/)  
* **getUser**: A user resource representing a registered user of the portal. Personal details of the user, such as e-mail and groups, are returned only to the user or the administrator of the user's organization (the properties in the Response Properties table below). A user is not visible to any other user (except the organization's administrator) if their access setting is set to private. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User/02r3000000m2000000/)  
* **getUserContent**: The user's content are items either in the home folder for the user, e.g. /content/users/<username>, or in a subfolder of the home folder with the given folder ID. Multilevel folders are not supported. You can also see the Quick reference topic for additional information on this. Items in a folder are stored by reference and are not physically in a folder. Rather, they're stored as links to the original item, e.g. /content/items/<itemId>. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User_Content/02r30000007p000000/)  
* **getUserInvitation**:  An individual invitation to join a given group. The user can accept the invitation or decline the invitation. Invitations are currently only to join groups but may be extended in the future to allow for other targetTypes. Developers should design their applications so that targetTypes is checked and unknown targetTypes are ignored. Invitations are also currently only sent to usernames. This is determined by the type property of the invitation. In the future, other types of invitations may be introduced. Developers should design their applications to make sure they check type and ignore unknown types. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User_Invitation/02r3000000mr000000/)  
* **getUserInvitations**: Shows the invitations sent to the authenticated user. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User_Invitations/02r3000000m7000000/)

[source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User_Tags/02r3000000m9000000/)  
* **searchUsers**: The User Search operation searches for users in the portal. The search index is updated whenever users are created, updated, or deleted. There can be a lag between the time that the user is updated and the time when it's reflected in the search results. The results only contain users that the calling user has permissions to see. Users can control this visibility by changing the access property of their user. Care should be taken when using ArcGIS REST API search operations (search, user search, group search) to find items, groups, and users programmatically. The Portal uses a powerful search engine to index information and to allow full text searching on it. This search engine uses many different inputs to find the appropriate results and rank them. This often makes search 'fuzzy', making it ideal for human interaction, but not necessarily ideal for looking for specific records programmatically. Developers should avoid using search to find specific items (e.g. by title) as the results of these types of queries might change as the search engine evolves. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/User_Search/02r3000000m6000000/)  
* **updateUser**: The Update User operation (POST only) modifies properties such as description, preferred view, tags, access, and thumbnail. The user name cannot be modified. For the 'ecas' identity provider, password, e-mail, and full name must be modified by editing your Esri Global Account. For the 'arcgis' identity provider, password, full name, security question, and security answer can be updated with Update User. Update User is available only to the user or to the administrator of the user's organization. Only the properties that are to be updated need to be specified in the request. Properties not specified will not be affected. [source](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Update_User/02r3000000m0000000/)
