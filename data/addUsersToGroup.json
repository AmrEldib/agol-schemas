Both users and admins can be added using this operation. This is useful if you wish to add users directly within an organization without requiring them to accept an invitation. For example, a member of an organization can add only other organization members but not public users. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Add_Users_to_Group/02r3000002mr000000/",
