## 0.3.3
  
**Added code documentation**  
The `docs` folder will now include one markdown file for each code file. It'll list all functions and their documentation.  
This documentation is generated using `documentation.js` library and JSDoc comments for every function.  

**Folder organization**  
Moved the `schemas.md` file to the new `docs` folder.
