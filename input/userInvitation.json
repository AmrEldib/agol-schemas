Invitations are currently only to join groups but may be extended in the future to allow for other targetTypes. Developers should design their applications so that targetTypes is checked and unknown targetTypes are ignored. Invitations are also currently only sent to usernames. This is determined by the type property of the invitation. In the future, other types of invitations may be introduced. Developers should design their applications to make sure they check type and ignore unknown types. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/User_Invitation/02r3000000mr000000/",
